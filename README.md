                                     ARDUINO: LIE DETECTOR.

1.  Here, the Arduino lie detector will play a vital role in my life as it is gonna help me more than anything because now I can know which roomate of mine is eating all the         stuff from the fridge.
2.  So my code is somewhat taken from Roumega but I have made many modifications in it. As per me it can only pe uploaded on the Arduino-uno and might work in other too but i       have not tried in any other device other than arduino-uno.
3.  The sketch uses a library “liquidcrystal.h” which is used to print the stuff on the lcd screen.
4.  I have added lcd screen(16*2);Piezo speaker in my project.
5.  I would provide my sketch here for a better view and better understanding of lie detector by me.

Repository Contents :
----------------------------------------------
Here is what I will provide in my repository in all the folders which I will upload separately .

1.  /src – My software for the device will be uploaded here in src(.ino).
2. /hardware – My schematic diagram as well as breadboard diagram and the design files will be uploaded here(fritzing).
3. /Review- My project review will be uploaded our here(.pptx).
4. /img – This is where the image files will be uploaded(.jpeg,.png).
5. /examples - The files i used or that can be uploaded on my device will be stored in here(.ino).
6. /Readme – all the stuff or may be overview will be uploaded here(this file).

Hardware/Material Used :
----------------------------------------------

1. Arduino -Uno.
2. Breadboard.
3. Lcd 16*2.
4. Piezo Speaker.
5. Potentiometer.
6. Red led - 1.
7. Green Led - 1.
8. White Led - 1.
9. 560 OHM Resistor - 4.
10. Jumper wires.

Build Instructions :
------------------------------------------------

Here, i would like to add my build so i will add my schematic daigram as well as my breadboard view the best understanding of my hardware.

Now i would like to add my breadboard view over here.

![Breadboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72887751/101516982-c7a5f180-3945-11eb-8a42-1f7f9b1d98b8.PNG)

Here as you can see in my original project i have used three different lights and an resistor of 560 ohm but in my breadboard view it is different. I have used different as the stuff that was available in fritzing.

The circuit :
-------------------------------------------------

Taking about my circuit i would like to mention here that how the circuit was made by me.

1. First of all i attached all the leds and the resistor in their ew=quivalent slots.
2. Afterwards i attached the wires to the pins.
3. Then i took a 162 lcd screen and attached it to the breadboard.
4. Then i attached all the wires with as shown in my breadboard view and also i connected a resistor to pin 15.
5. Then after, i connected the potentiometer so that i can change the potentiometer is required to get the proper printing on the lcd screen.
6. Atlast, i connected the piezo speaker which start to beeps when some one is wrong.
7. Now we will connect arduino with pc and run the program and will check if our lie detector works properly or not.

Working :
--------------------------------------------------

The working of my arduino lie detector will be as follows.

1. First of all i build my hardware part of my lie detector.
2. Then i started with the code but most of the part of the code is taken from the Dante Roumega's part of code but i have made some modifications as well as i did added a     header file for the lcd in it and i did also make many changes in it.
3. This project is choosen by me because i am now litreally done with my roommates as i never know that who eats the stuff from fridge. Sometimes to get the truth out you better use some ideas.
4. So at first i would get my wires with the foil in to the middle and index finger of the person i want to get tested.
5. Afterwards , i will start my detector and upload the code.
6. Then after, i would show him/her the graph he/she gets without asking any kind of question.
7. Now i would ask him/her question and if he/she is right then it will be green light on the arduino and the speaker will be silent and the lcd will print he key word 
"You are right".
8. If at all he/she speaks wrong the nervousness in their fingertips will be caught by the wires and the speaker will start buzzing along with the red light and lcd will prompt
"you are wrong".
9. Hence, this would be my lie detector for you.
10. Though it won't be used in serious situations but i would love to use this cool thing on someone in near future.


Team :
--------------------------------------------------

1. Daidipya Nayan Jadhav - I did everything including hardware,software,proposal,github and almost every thing.
2. Drashti Patel - She helped me with her arduino kit(she gave her kit to me as it consist of almost everything i wanted for my project) and writeup.

Truly speaking that it was not that hard project but because of my laziness I got many drawbacks with my milestone but many were reached at time too.

                                                         
                                                         
                                                         
                                                         
                                                          THANK YOU
