                                     ARDUINO: LIE DETECTOR.

1.  Here, the Arduino lie detector will play a vital role in my life as it is gonna help me more than anything because now I can know which roomate of mine is eating all the         stuff from the fridge.
2.  So my code is somewhat taken from Roumega but I have made many modifications in it. As per me it can only pe uploaded on the Arduino-uno and might work in other too but i       have not tried in any other device other than arduino-uno.
3.  The sketch uses a library “liquidcrystal.h” which is used to print the stuff on the lcd screen.
4.  I have added lcd screen(16*2);Piezo speaker in my project.
5.  I would provide my sketch here for a better view and better understanding of lie detector by me.
